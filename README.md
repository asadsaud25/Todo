# ✅ TODO App - Eisenhower Matrix

Welcome to the TODO App, a task management application designed to help you prioritize your tasks efficiently using the **Eisenhower Matrix**! 🎯. This project is developed by **Asad Saud** 👨‍💻, a pre-final year undergraduate student at **Aligarh Muslim University**, as part of his journey in mastering Android development. 📱

## 🚀 Project Overview

The TODO App is aimed at providing users with a straightforward yet effective way to organize their tasks into four categories based on their urgency and importance. By classifying tasks, users can focus on what truly matters, leading to better productivity. 💡

### 📊 Eisenhower Matrix

The **Eisenhower Matrix** is a time management tool that helps you decide and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not spend much time on. The matrix divides tasks into four categories:
1. **Urgent & Important** (Do First) 🔥
2. **Important but Not Urgent** (Schedule) 📅
3. **Urgent but Not Important** (Delegate) 🤝
4. **Neither Urgent nor Important** (Delete) 🗑️

This classification helps users make informed decisions on what to prioritize in their day-to-day tasks.

## ✨ Features (Implemented/In Progress)

- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Firebase authentication allows users to register, log in, and maintain their task lists across devices.
- ✍️ **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks with a title and description.
- 🗂️ **Task Categorization**: Tasks are classified based on the Eisenhower Matrix, helping users prioritize effectively.
- 📝 **Task Update & Deletion**: Users can modify or delete tasks as needed.
